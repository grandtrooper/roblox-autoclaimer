# Roblox group autoclaimer

This took a long time to make and wasnt easy

Make sure to add enough cookies in cookies.txt

75% completed i just have to make the gateway error handling better with the resuming session stuff

Make sure to change the config.json to your stuff

```json
{
    "version": "5.3.4",
    "token": "MTEzNzQ4NDA0NTUwMTA5MjAxMg...",
    "webhooks": {
        "logs": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/",
        "detections": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/",
        "errors": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/"
    },
}
```

This new version works by directly connecting to the discord gateway which is the fasest way
